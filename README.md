# Flutter Test App

A toy project to learn about building an application using the Flutter & Dart ecosystem.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application built using the [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension in VS Code.

After installing the Flutter extension in VS Code, you can hit `cmd + shift + p` to open the command palette and run the `Flutter: New Project` command. This will create a new Flutter project in the directory of your choosing

Note: If you don't have the Flutter SDK installed, you will be prompted to install it. I recommend adding it to your PATH and you should be good to go.

You can also achieve this via the CLI by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter create `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`
```
